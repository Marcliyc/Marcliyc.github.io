Investigated failure and success modes of Dirichlet boundary condition enforcement for PINNs on 2D Stokes flow around a cylinder.

**Highlights**
- Compared soft penalties and hard-constraint distance-filter ansätze across boundary subsets.
- Proposed a hybrid hard-soft boundary strategy with substantial velocity-field accuracy gains.
- Analyzed high-frequency amplification caused by strict hard constraints on specific boundaries.
