Developed a multi-agent game-theoretic framework where users strategically trade personalization utility against privacy risk, while a platform optimizes global outcomes under privacy constraints.

**Highlights**
- Derived equilibrium conditions and best-response dynamics.
- Implemented time-series simulations with Python/Gymnasium and Deep-RL-based policies.
- Observed substantial reward gains over single-action baseline strategies.
