collection: portfolio
---

Designed and implemented a GRPO-GR training framework to improve policy optimization stability and sample efficiency in large-scale machine learning systems.

**Highlights**
- Explored grouped relative objectives for more reliable policy updates.
- Built modular training and evaluation utilities for reproducible experimentation.
- Benchmarked optimization behavior across different reward and regularization settings.
