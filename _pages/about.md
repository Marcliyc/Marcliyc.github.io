Hi! I'm **Yicheng (Marco) Li**, an MSE Data Science student at the University of Pennsylvania and an NYU graduate.

I work at the intersection of **machine learning**, **LLM**, and **AI for science**, with interests spanning representation learning, robust model adaptation, reinforcement learning, and physically grounded learning systems.
